# 0. Functions, Variables

**Function** = action or a verb that let us do something in the program. Generally speaking, any language is coming with some predetermined sets of very basics actions or verbs that a computer already know how to do for it.

Example : 

```python
print("hello word")
```

**Bug** = mistake in a program, it can takes many forms, problems for us to solve.

print("xxx") --> affiche la chaîne de caractères xxx
input() --> attends qu'un utilisateur entre une chaîne de caractère ou un caractère, curseur en attente d'une réponse (textuelle) 

**Variables** = type of data that stock in the memory a value of a data

Example :

```python
name = input("What's your name? ")
print("hello," name)
```
```python
name = input("What's your name? ")
print("hello")
print(name)
```

**Comments** = notes to ourselves in our code, ignored by the computer (for us, our teacher or mentor to review the code) & could be used for pseudocode (allow us to write our program before)
